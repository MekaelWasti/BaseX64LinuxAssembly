Your program will input 2 values from the user using the scanf() function, after showing a prompt using the printf() function:

The user's first name (a string, no more than 50 characters)
The user's current age (an integer)
Create variables for these two values (name, age) in the data section of the program, along with prompt strings for each.

Note:  To read a string from the console, the C code would look like this:

scanf("%s", string_var);

Note:  To read an integer from the console the C code would look like this:

scanf("%d", &int_var); 

Note: In C, '&int_var' means the address of the variable 'int_var', which is not required for strings, since string variables are already addresses.  In assembly language, all variables are addresses, so you don't need to do anything special.
